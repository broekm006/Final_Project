This is a assignment for the minor "programmeren" from the UvA. This is a proposal for the final project. 

***

"Companion app" > Black ops 4

__Problem statement__
Everyday fans of the game ask questions like what steps do we have to follow in other to do an easter egg or which weapon is better. Because googling everyting or rewachting youtube videos won't do the trick. It is time an application is created to simplify this process and make a “central hub”. In this hub you need to be able to find everything you need without the hassle.

***

__Description__
An application that gives intel / insight to the game black ops 4. In this application you can find all the details for which weapon is available and how the weapons rank to each other (damage, recoil, etc…). Besides the weapon overview you can also find everything related to easter eggs (what the steps are and how to find them). And finally for blackout you can see side easter eggs and how to unlock every (unlockable) character. Target Audiance: Players of the game / me
 
__Features__
__Blackout__
Weapons: (model), available weapons, stats
character unlocks: Which available, where to get, missions -> how to unlock
(side ee) > Which easter eggs are known within blackout

__Multiplayer__
Weapons: (model), available weapons, stats
(side ee) > Which easter eggs are known within multiplayer

__Zombies__
Weapons: (model), available weapons, stats
EE: main ee for each map + side ee
Buildables: Which are available, where are the parts, build locations

***

__Solution__
Create an application that gives insight into everything that is available in black ops 4 and do it in a clean and simple fashion.
